# Dieter Rams’ 10 Design Principles in 3D (WIP)

A lightweight three.js project showcasing Dieter Rams’ ten design principles through an interactive 3D animation.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a three.js‐based web experience that highlights the essence of Dieter Rams’ famous design principles. Each principle is represented by a 3D scene or animation, allowing you to explore and interact with the concepts in a visual, immersive way.

---

## Live Demo

A working (but still evolving) version is deployed on Vercel:
[https://ten-principles.vercel.app/](https://ten-principles.vercel.app/)
